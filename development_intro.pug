| I have more than a third of a century of development experience: I started by writing COBOL programs for
| a #[a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom') Jacquard loom] early in Abraham Lincoln's second term.
| My code has run on everything
| from tablets to mobile phones to PDAs to desktops to VAXen to mainframes. I have written primarily
| in Java and JavaScript since the mid- to late-1990s, but have also coded for a living in PHP, C / C++, BASIC, and XSLT over
| the years.
