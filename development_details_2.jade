| #[br] My recent development projects have used node.js, AngularJS, NoSQL databases (primarily 
| Couch and Mongo), Jade, Bootstrap, and IBM's Bluemix Garage Method (built on Jenkins and 
| Slack for CI and DevOps). I 
| am currently focused on writing business rules and user interfaces for 
| IBM products as well as single-page applications that showcase the Bluemix PaaS and the services it provides. #[br] #[br]
