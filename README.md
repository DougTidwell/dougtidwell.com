# dougtidwell.com
This is the source for the dougtidwell.com website. The source code is a combination of HTML5, CSS3, a little JavaScript, and some Jade templates that get compiled into an HTML file that uses Bootstrap to provide the responsive features we need. 

Future versions of the site will be built on Angular2 and TypeScript....
