This is the source for the dougtidwell.com website. The source code is a combination of HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and a Jenkins config file to automate the process of converting the source code (such as it is) into a website that works in any browser on any device. The website is based on node.js, but uses Express, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Cloudant, MongoDB, and other next-generation technologies.
