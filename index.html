students to executives and analysts. I have worked with audiences in 
person at conferences and customer sites as well as remotely via webinars and podcasts. My presentations have won several awards, 
including a 2009 JavaOne Rock Star award for "Using SOAP and <span class="nowrap">WS-*</span> in the Cloud."
<br> <br> The technologies I 
have evangelized include cloud computing, REST, SOAP and the <span class="nowrap">WS-*</span> stack, 
XSLT, XML, Java, Eclipse, Service Component Architecture, and XForms. In all cases, I created the 
presentations or student handbooks that explained the technology and built the sample code or exercises 
that showed it in action. (As an example, you can take a look at <a href="examples/Hands-on_workshop_slides-letter.pdf">the slides</a>, 
<a href="examples/Hands-on_workshop_handouts-letter.pdf">the lab manual,</a> and 
<a href="examples/workshop.zip">the sample code</a> for the Service Component Architecture workshop I created.) <br> <br><blockquote><em>Pro Tip #2:</em> When stuck on the streets of Mumbai at rush hour, your taxi driver may decide to cross the median of a 12-lane highway, 
drive at a high rate of speed into oncoming traffic, and then dodge back onto the correct side of the road at the last 
possible second. This is perfectly normal, legal, and unremarkable. </blockquote>Since 2011 my evangelism efforts have been internally focused, 
with presentations, sample code, and research papers developed for IBM's sales staff, business 
partners, and select customers. My current assignment focuses on IBM's cloud portfolio, including the Bluemix PaaS and OpenStack-based products such as 
IBM Cloud Orchestrator. Driving revenue is my primary goal these days.
